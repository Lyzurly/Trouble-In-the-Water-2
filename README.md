## Concept:
### Catch all the different fish types and show them off! But beware... a monstrous fish is lurking, and doesn't like you taking its food...
_Stretch goal:_ And become number one on InstaFish! 

<li>Fishing spots appear under shadow fish</li>
<li>Activating a fishing spot starts a fishing minigame</li>
<li>Proximity to the biggest shadow indicates increased risk of monster attacking after catch.</li>
<li>Or, risk that the catch IS the monster</li>
<li>The monster chases the player until escape conditions are met, then it returns to the water, unless the player is caught.</li>
<li>If the player is caught, they're knocked down, and a random number/assortment of fish are eaten in their house, and the names/numbers of losses are display on screen as text.
<li>Fish can be displayed in a player "home", along with how many in nearby crates</li>

_Stretch goal:_
<li>And also displayed/catalogued on "InstaFish" social media site</li>
<li>InstaFish has other fishers on it, and their numbers gradually increase either over time or as you get further?</li>
<li>A shop to sell fish? and buy traps maybe for catching even the monster.</li>
